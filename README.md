# ORIENT-BELL-TILES
For a recent hackathon, I tackled the frontend for an Orientbell Tiles concept. I focused on creating a clean, user-friendly interface to browse and visualize their tile collections. It was a fast-paced project, aiming to deliver a functional and visually appealing experience within the hackathon's timeframe.
